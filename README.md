# InSURE

The dataset being used in our project is a medical insurance dataset gathered from Kaggle. The goal
of the project is to identify the factors that might be related with predicting the medical insurance
charges and assign weightage to these factors to obtain an equation. The variables in question are
age, BMI (Body Mass Index), children, gender, and location. In other words, a statistical model is
performed using these parameters to predict the insurance cost incurred. The goal is not limited to
predicting these charges but goes as far as to compute the reliability of the model and tries to
strengthen it by taking significant data into account
